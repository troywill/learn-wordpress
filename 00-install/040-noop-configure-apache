1. Install the "php-apache" package from extra using pacman.
2. Add these lines in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
     Place this in the "LoadModule" list anywhere after LoadModule dir_module modules/mod_dir.so:
       LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
     Place this at the end of the "Include" list:
       Include conf/extra/php5_module.conf

3. Add this line in /etc/httpd/conf/mime.types:
   application/x-httpd-php		php php5


       

If your DocumentRoot is not /srv/http, add it to open_basedir in /etc/php/php.ini as such:
 open_basedir=/srv/http/:/home/:/tmp/:/usr/share/pear/:/path/to/documentroot
Restart the Apache service to make changes take effect:
 # /etc/rc.d/httpd restart
A test file for PHP is included by default and can be found in /srv/http
Remember to copy this file to ~/public_html if you permitted such a configuration.
Test PHP: http://localhost/test.php or http://localhost/~myname/test.php
If this file does not exist, just place the following in /srv/http/test.php:
 <?php phpinfo(); ?>
If the PHP instruction is not executed (you see : <html>...</html>), check that you have added "Includes" to the "Options" line for your root directory. Moreover, make sure you have this line in your <IfModule mime_module> section:
 AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
